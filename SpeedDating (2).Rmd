## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

##Looking at the coefficients in the summary output. The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the stronger the influence of that variable on the decision (DecisionM). Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship, and negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship. The p-values will tell you whether each coefficient is statistically significant.
